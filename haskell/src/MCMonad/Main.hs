-- Focus event dispatch
--
-- 'FocusedWindowChanged' (from AX) and 'FrontAppChanged' (from NSWorkspace
-- / SkyLight 1508) are normally followed because they are the only signals
-- that distinguish multi-window-per-app focus changes, but they fire just
-- as readily for macOS' internal focus-settling bounces as for legitimate
-- user intent. While 'focusIntent' is armed, mcmonad's StackSet is the
-- source of truth and these events are classified against the intent:
--
--   * exact match (wid + pid) — confirmation, no-op.
--   * same app, different window — intra-app focus change (user clicking
--     another window of the target's app); accept it and clear intent.
--   * anything else — bounce or spurious cross-app divergence; re-issue
--     'FocusWindow' to push macOS back to the target and decrement the
--     budget. When the budget exhausts the intent clears so user-
--     initiated cross-app focus changes eventually take effect.

-- See the 'MCMonad.Core.FocusIntent' note for the full rationale.
